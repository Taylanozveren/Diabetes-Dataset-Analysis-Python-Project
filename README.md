# Python Project: Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis
In this project, I performed the following steps in two separate notebooks and bonus detailed notebooks


Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA,) Feature Selection and Engineering, Data Splitting, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Testing and Validation, Model Deployment, Data Visualization

In Part 1, I carried out the Basic Level EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and visualization sections, while in Part 2, I worked on the Model Development phase. Throughout these analysis processes, I provided detailed explanations. I tried to emphasize the importance of each step for data science. Through this project file, I created a cheat sheet for my future work. By using these project files, you can obtain a comprehensive source of code and theoretical knowledge regarding the data analysis and model development processes.
The third part, which I added later to my project, is dedicated to making the EDA analyses more realistic and meaningful for real-life applications. In the final part, I included a section on feature engineering and feature importance, explaining how more meaningful analyses can be performed with the added features.
